# Development Notes - Reading Journal API

## Project Goals
- Deep dive into FastAPI beyond Next.js server actions
- Practice production-grade backend patterns (auth, migrations, testing)
- Build something deployable with proper DevOps practices

## Day 1 - Project Scaffold
**Date**: [1 December 2025]

**What I Built**:
- Basic FastAPI app structure with routers
- Successfully ran development server

**Learnings**:
- FastAPI's automatic API docs (Swagger) are incredible - much better than manually writing API documentation

**Challenges**:
- Ran into a NoneType Error as include.router is a method rather than a decorator
